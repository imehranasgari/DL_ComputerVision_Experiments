# CIFAR-10 Deep Learning Experiments

## Problem Statement and Goal of Project
Train, evaluate, and experiment with convolutional neural network architectures on the CIFAR-10 dataset to explore the effects of different training techniques, optimizations, and regularization methods.

## Solution Approach
- Implemented and trained a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
- Applied data augmentation (random flips, translations, zoom) to improve generalization.
- Utilized mixed precision training for faster computation on GPUs.
- Experimented with Batch Normalization and activation function changes.
- Compared SELU activation vs Batch Normalization impact on training.
- Tested Dropout regularization and Monte-Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation.
- Applied L1/L2 regularization for controlling model complexity.
- Compared different optimizers for training performance.
